<h1 style="border-bottom:2px solid #000066;">Introduction:</h1>
<p style="font-size:17px;">Hi, I am Komal. I graduated with a Computer Science degree from COMSATS Lahore and start doing Web development course in Kics Uet.It is a well known platform for its courses.My father is Electrical Engineer and he works for Siemens as General Manager Sales and my mother is a medical doctor. My sister is studying in school. I have a very jolly personality and interested in experiencing new things. I love playing chess and have even represented my school and college in various competitions and events. </p>
<h1 style="border-bottom:2px solid #000066;">Experties:</h1>
<p style="font-size:17px;">My expertise lies in html, CSS, bootstrap, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Microsoft Office Tools.I can Install and run almost every software of any Operating System.I Know Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, Android, Chrome OS, Symbian OS, Backtrack.Recently did a semester project of Database and Design the Prototype of the Application.I did a semester project of Web Engineering on Laravel and made a BLOG.My strengths are Being self motivated and punctual.I am passionate about photography so I am an amateur photographer and have displayed my work twice in the photography exhibitions in the city.</p>

<h1 style="border-bottom:2px solid #000066;">Strength & Interest:</h1>
<p style="font-size:17px;">I believe that life is a learning experience and being able to recognize our own strengths and weaknesses can help us become better individuals in anything we choose to do, whether it is positive abilities and skills that can help achieve our goals or negative personal areas that need improvement.My strengths are that I am extremely observant, determined and have a great outlook on life however; being thoughtful and practical are the many other characteristics that mold me into the person I am. Knowing yourself and what you can do, can help you recognize and overcome your weaknesses.One of my greatest strengths at work that I have recognized would have to be my ability to be a well-organized individual. I tend to write what I have to do down on paper and prioritize what is more important to least important. In doing this, it helps me organize and accomplish my work and meet deadlines that are important.I am certain that because of my strengths, I am good at what I do however; I do have weaknesses that I have to overcome and improve. My personal weakness at work is lack of leadership. Currently I am in a position in which I do not possess the title of management. As a result, I basically feel that I do not have to show leadership or take initiative to take on the responsibilities of a manager when in reality, I am not. One of my weaknesses at home is time management. </p>
